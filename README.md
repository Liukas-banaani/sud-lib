const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>

## Customization

You can easily customize the styles of the components to fit your design requirements. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Using Props**: Most components accept props that allow you to change colors, sizes, and other styles.
2. **CSS Overrides**: You can apply your own CSS classes to override default styles.
3. **Theme Provider**: Use a theme provider to set global styles for all components.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'sud-lib';

const App = () => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);

  return (
    <ThemeProvider darkMode={darkMode}>
      <button onClick={() => setDarkMode(!darkMode)}>
        Toggle Dark Mode
      </button>
      <Button label="Click Me" />
    </ThemeProvider>
